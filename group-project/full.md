## Measurement/Empirical Study(We choose):  

These projects require you to establish a rigorous and repeatable methodology for studying a system or phenomenon related to privacy-enhancing technologies using empirical data. This often involves developing benchmarks, conducting experiments, and analyzing results to extract meaningful insights.  

- Empirical study of DeFi attacks.   
- Rethinking previous privacy-enhancing technologies through empirical evaluation (e.g., analyze the effectiveness of existing privacy protection mechanisms against new threats).  

The focus should be on establishing a repeatable methodology, gathering and analyzing data, identifying key metrics and questions for measurement, and extracting data-driven insights. Consider aspects like incentive structures, performance metrics (throughput, latency), security, and other system-level properties.  

测量/实证研究:
这些项目需要你建立一个严格的和可重复的方法来研究
与使用经验数据的隐私增强技术相关的系统或现象。这
通常包括开发基准、进行实验和分析结果
提取有意义的见解。
- DeFi攻击的实证研究。
- 通过实证评估重新思考以前的隐私增强技术(例如，
分析现有隐私保护机制对新隐私保护机制的有效性威胁)。

重点应该是建立一种可重复的方法，收集和分析数据，
确定衡量的关键指标和问题，并提取数据驱动的见解。
考虑激励结构、性能指标（吞吐量、延迟）、安全性、
以及其他系统级属性。

# Proposal Grading Criteria

A proposal template form “CS6290-project-proposal.docx” is provided. The primary scoring criteria includes:  

1. Relevance/importance of problem $(30\%)$ Articulate the project's significance and impact concisely, justifying its importance within the course and beyond (e.g., explain problem's value, real-world relevance, and connection to course concepts).   
2. Feasibility $(50\%)$ Demonstrate a focused and achievable project scope within the given constraints (e.g., show realistic project scale, resource consideration, and manageable goals).   
3. Timeline realism $(20\%)$ Present a concise, realistic weekly timeline with clear milestones and task assignments achievable within the project duration (e.g., detail weekly tasks, task ownership, and demonstrate time management).  

Notice: Proposal scores will NOT affect your grade, but top teams get first choice of final presentation timeslots!  

# Project Report Grading Criteria $(85\%)$

A report template “CS6290-project-template.pdf” is provided to guide you on report context and structure. Note that, the template is only for reference. Your report may not be restricted to it. In this project, we will use the following guidelines for grading purposes. Hopefully, all projects can be roughly mapped to the criteria below.  

## 1. Motivation $(15\%)$

Clearly articulate the scope and significance of your project. Highlight key results and discoveries.  

## 2. Background on studied problem $(25\%)$

Provide a thorough description of your chosen topic, tracing its origins and current research trends. Use visual aids like graphs for clarity.  

## 3. Results and finding $(25\%)$

Present a detailed analysis of your findings, including literature study summaries, improvements, solutions, and any original insights (e.g., data analysis with tables and figures).  

## 4. Style and writing $(10\%)$  

Assessment will consider the overall quality of writing, grammar, and presentation.  

## 5. References $(10\%)$

Adhere to established academic referencing standards (e.g., IEEE). Ensure that references are relevant, credible, and comprehensive, reflecting the depth and scope of your research.  

# Project Presentation Grading Criteria $(15\%)$

## 1. Slide quality $(5\%)$  

Slides should incorporate graphic novel elements such as layout, figures, or text, with specific panel or page references. Employ multiple colors and figures to underscore main points. Ensure legibility with sufficiently large print. Use bullet points, keywords, or short phrases for clarity and brevity.  

## 2. Oral presentation fluency $(5\%)$

Deliver your presentation with minimal hesitation, ensuring clear communication of ideas.  

## 3. Correctness $(5\%)$

The content of your presentation must accurately and clearly reflect the findings and arguments of your final report.

# Notice:

1. Without quotation or SIGNIFICANT paraphrasing, the use of ANY sentence from other people's work (e.g., paper, article, Internet document, etc), even with citation, in your report constitutes plagiarism. No exception. Paraphrasing needs to be significant. Trivial paraphrasing other people’ sentences still constitutes plagiarism. Note that, all your reports will go through the Turnitin system for originality check.   
2. Academic honesty when using the GenAI tools: GenAI tools are permitted for research, brainstorming, and improving writing style and clarity. You must acknowledge any use of AI. Generating the final report content using GenAI is NOT permitted. Your report must reflect your own original writing and analysis.
